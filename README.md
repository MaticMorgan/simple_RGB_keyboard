# simple_RGB_keyboard

I had an obsolete, cheap keyboard that only had on/off switchable RGB lighs with no effects and adjustments. I decided to use an Arduino to make a simple program with a few buttons and potentiomenters (and later on a piezo buzzer) to make the keyboard somewhat interesting and give myself a fun project to work on. I now use it at work since it's better than the regular office keyboard I was given.

A easyEDA file is given if someone wants to recreate something similar as well as an Instructables article where I decribe in depth how it works and I how decided what exactly to do.
